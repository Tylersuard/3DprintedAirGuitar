Now you can play your very own Air-Guitar!

The Story:

It was 1992. My head hung low as I paced through the black-brick hallways of a backstage area in some part of northern Europe. I had just failed to qualify for the 1994 Air-Guitar Olympics, to be held in Stockholm, Norway.

I swore, on that day, that I would become the greatest Air-Guitarist of them all.

I quickly realized, that in order to practice my moves, and make them authentic, I would need to use a real guitar, but the strings hurt my fingies.

I decided to wait until technology was available to make my air-guitar moves actually make sound. Recently, 3D Printing technology was unearthed from the ancient ruins of Mesopotamia, and I had my opportunity.

I used this magical witchcraft to form a 3D-Printable Air Guitar that anyone could play, myself included.

Feel free to jam around on it.

1998 olympics, here I come!
